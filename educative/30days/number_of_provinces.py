    Given n cities, some are directly connected, and others are not. You are given an n√ón matrix called cities, where cities[i][j] = 1
 means city ith and city jth are directly connected, and cities[i][j] =0 means they are not directly connected.
The task is to return the total number of groups of connected cities directly or indirectly. These groups are referred to as provinces.
